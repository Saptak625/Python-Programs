# Python-Programs
These are the programs I created during my early years of Python development. 

This repository includes many projects from 2018 to current day.

* __Cryptography Capstone Project:__ A majority of the files in the repository are from my 7th grade capstone project on cryptography. I implemented many standard symmetric private-key ciphers, as well, some custom open pad cipher implementations (Das Code).
* __OOP Programming:__ I got into OOP and did some hobby projects to test my understanding of this paradigm with regard to other programming techniques like recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
* __Hobby Projects__: I built a number of projects and programs during my experience in 8th grade Future Cities. Many of these were just to mess/troll with friends, but this gave the foundation of the idea of making programs for my own personal utility (whether for having a laugh, ideating something for the fun of it, or automating everything I do).
* __Loan Financing__: I created a number of programs to simulate different loan financing scenarios such as refinancing, lump sums, etc for my 8th grade Science Fair project "Demystifying Loans." This would calculate all the amortization table properties monthly and greatly helped with simulating more complex situations otherwise not possible in Excel.
* __Chemical Equation Balancer__: This was my Python implementation of one of my first automation/solver projects originally in Java (https://github.com/Saptak625/chem-equation-balancers-java). This project has always been one of my favorites as the conclusions and ideas from this project have constantly been revisted and revised to this very day!
* __Gimkit Simulations__: I ran a large brute-force simulation of different Gimkit stategies. I specifically looked at the order of the purchase of the primary upgrades (disregarding the powerups). This simulation gave very insightful conclusions on the optimal Gimkit strategy, which I have been able to utilize regularly to gain a cutting-edge advantage in any Gimkit game.
* __Other Notable Mentions__: There are a variety of other random programs in this repository. A couple projects of note:
  * __Blocks World:__ Primitive AI Program based on 6.034 MIT AI course (https://github.com/Saptak625/BlocksWorldAI)
  * __Random Math Solvers:__ There a bunch of math programs I made to test different math algorithms (prime factorization, primality tests) along with other random math calculation programs. 
  * __Fireworks!!!:__ I created a pygame implementation of a fireworks display with realistic physics. This project mesmerizing to watch!
